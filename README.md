# Survey Form

This is a simple survey form about the user experience with the freeCodeCamp course.
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course and it's based on HTML and CSS.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/survey-form.git
```

Then go in the **random_quotes_generator** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.

You can have a look at the app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/survey-form/).


## Main features

In this project I used several HTML form structures:
* text/integer input;
* selection;
* checkboxes;
* radio buttons;
* textarea.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
